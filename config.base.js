   *
   * TRACT, not block group. The previous layer here
   * (RaleighBlockGroups_2014_2018_AllFields) was block group, but it mixed ACS
   * 2014-2018 tenure percentages with Esri MODELLED current-year estimates
   * (the _CY fields), and it carried no cost-burden data at all. These layers
   * are wholly ACS tabulations. The cost is resolution: Raleigh is 293 block
   * groups but only 119 tracts, roughly 2.5 to 1, so the map reads smoother and
   * small-area contrasts around individual projects get averaged away.
   *
   * Both are "(Latest)" views, meaning Esri repoints them at each new ACS
   * 5-year release. Field NAMES are stable (they are census table codes) but the
   * VINTAGE moves without warning, which is why the panel note reads the year
   * from the service instead of hardcoding it.
   *
   * Both are national. `where` is REQUIRED: without it these are ~85,000-tract
   * queries per indicator.
   *
   * `ratio` indicators declare their numerator and denominator fields once;
   * index.html generates BOTH the Arcade valueExpression that draws the map and
   * the JavaScript that computes class breaks from that one declaration, so the
   * two can never drift apart.
